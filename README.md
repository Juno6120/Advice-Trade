# Advice-Trade
Hello! This is a simple Node.js + Express application that fetches random advice from the Advice Slip API and displays it using EJS templates. It also includes a small registration form that sends an email through EmailJS using the code inside header.ejs. In here, you can trade with me pieces of advice so we can both gain thoughtful new insights!
